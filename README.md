# hello-world
This repository is used for practicing with git.

## .gitignore
* Affects files in subfolders
* Does not affect files in parent folders
* Each folder can have its own '.gitignore' file
* Does not work if the file already exists in the repository
* If you delete the file and push the changes it will start functioning as intended
* The command `git add *` will not add files in '.gitignore'. However, it will add files that were created in subfolders.
